# TODO list for project from Matt


1. Create simple form to repurpose for my form entity builder
2. Rework the simple form to create a user

**Need to confirm with Matt that the direction I'm heading with this is correct**

# How I understand an entitiy

- Can basically be anything
- With this project if I create a form you fill out specfic fields
- It creates a object of some kind from what you entered
- Then displays the object at the bottom of the screen

**NOTE maybe use generate to add theming**
